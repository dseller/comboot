--------------------------

1. PACKETS

1.1 CLIENT IDENTIFICATION PACKET

This is the very first packet that is sent by the client upon booting.
It is sent to let the boot server know that a client is waiting for a kernel file.

 |0|0|0|1|.|.|.|.|			
		  | | | `------ no high memory available
          | | `-------- reserved
          |	`---------- reserved
          `------------ reserved

1.2 SERVER IDENTIFICATION PACKET

This packet is sent as a response to the Client Identification Packet (1.1).

 |0|0|0|1|.|.|.|.|
	          `--------- id string follows; server sends 8 bytes of ASCII.

1.3 REQUEST FILE PACKET

This is sent by the client to the server to request a certain file. Files have IDs,
which the BOOTSRV utility maps to actual files on the host system. Usually, file 0 is
the stage2 bootloader, and file 1 is the kernel.

 |0|0|.|.|.|.|.|.|
	  | | | `----------- 3-bits file ID
	  | | `------------- request with high speed (115200 bauds).
	  `----------------- opcode: 10 = request 16-bits, 11 = request 32-bits.

1.3.1 HIGH SPEED FILE REQUEST

When the file is requested in high speed, the server will, obviously, reconfigure 
the serial connection to 115200 bauds. The client will need to do this is as well
if the file transfer is to be carried out successfully.

After the file transfer is finished, both the server and the client have to revert
back to 9600 bauds. This way, any subsequent communication can always be performed.

1.4 FILE RESPONSE

The file response always directly follows the request file packet as described in 1.3. 
First, the server sends an integer containing the size of the file. If the client requested
a 16-bit file, this is a 16-bit value. Of course, if the client requested a 32-bit file,
this will be a 32-bit value.

(TODO: 16-bits checksum)

After this integer, the raw data is sent.
